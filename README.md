# Tumor-Classification-HNSC
This repository can classify each patch to the binary class (Tumor_Epithelium vs Non_Tumor_Epithelium)

We have diiferent backbone for traing tumor model we can choose whatever you want 
I have added Inference file that will take all patch coordinates from whole slide and give those patche coordinates which have only tumor
Do this task i have trained and tested on random patch coordinates from different wsi for robustness of our model
